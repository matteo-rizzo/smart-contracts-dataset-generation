    "name": "Reentrancy with Delegatecall",
    "scenario": "Using `delegatecall` to execute code from another contract within the context of the calling contract can introduce reentrancy.",
    "example": "function execute(address callee, bytes memory data) public {\n    (bool success, ) = callee.delegatecall(data);\n    require(success, \"Delegatecall failed\");\n}",
    "issue": "If `callee` contains malicious code that reenters the original contract, it can manipulate its state."
